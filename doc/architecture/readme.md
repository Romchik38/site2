# Architecture

A website's code consists of the following levels:

- Application
- Domain
- Infrastructure

## Application

All app classes you can find in the [application folder](./../../app/code/Application/). They contain logic, work with [domain](./../../app/code/Domain/) directly and  with [infrastructure](./../../app/code/Infrastructure/) through interfaces.

For convenience, the classes are distributed by domain names, as this level depends on it.
The following parts in the folder names have the following meaning:

- `admin` - admin part
- `list` - the service is responsible for fetching the list of models
- `view` - working with a single model
- `domain_name` - shows a work with a specific domain

For example - [ArticleView](./../../app/code/Application/Article/AdminView/) - is a service that responsible to show an article to visitor. For the web part, this is when `/article/article_id` URL is requested. The `article_id` is an `identifier` from the `article` database table. All `Infrastructure services` like `http`, `console` etc, must use it to show the visitor.

Inside, each folder contains the `service itself`, a `repository interface`, `errors`, `commands`, and `read models` in the form of DTOs.

For example - [ArticleView](./../../app/code/Application/Article/AdminView/) service contains files:

- [AdminView](./../../app/code/Application/Article/AdminView/AdminView.php) - app service.
- [RepositoryInterface](./../../app/code/Application/Article/AdminView/RepositoryInterface.php) - a data access interface.
- [RepositoryException](./../../app/code/Application/Article/AdminView/RepositoryException.php) - during implementation, the repository must throws this error.
- [NoSuchArticleException](./../../app/code/Application/Article/AdminView/NoSuchArticleException.php) - the repository must throws this error if the requested model does not exist
- [CouldNotFindException](./../../app/code/Application/Article/AdminView/NoSuchArticleException.php) - this error is used by the service to indicate that something went wrong and the program must be stopped. This applies only to the `find` command. This error is caught by the infrastructure layer like `http action`.
- [Dtos](./../../app/code/Application/Article/AdminView/Dto/) - a list of `read models` that the infrastructure layer can expect when using the service.

The service `ArticleView` doesn't contain any commands, because it's very simple. When considering this service, the term `command` refers to the `find` function of the class. For other classes that have more complex logic, separate commands in the form of classes are provided.

## Domain

You can find all domain classes in the [domain folder](./../../app/code/Domain/). They contain logic, and have knowledge only about themselves and other domains.

A domain class contains state and validates it before creating an instance or performing a relevant action.

Read more about [entities](./../Entities/) rules.

For example - class [aricle](./../../app/code/Domain/Article/Article.php):

- contains all categories, languages, translations, audio, image, author, views.
- has an `active` or `inactive` status
- `before activation`, checks for all conditions - image, author, audio are active, translations exist and match the provided languages, also, the article must be added to at least one category

A service that works with a model expects the possibility of an `InvalidArgumentException` if inappropriate data is passed to the model, or an `CouldNotChangeActivityException` if the model's state does not meet the activation conditions. Some models may have other error classes provided.

The website *Site2* contains simple models, so only the `activation state` is provided. If there is a need for new models, the number of states can be increased.

## Infrastructure

Infrastructure includes services that either use application services themselves to obtain data, or repositories used by application services to access data, or utils to manipulate data.

- `Services that use application services themselves` - [web](./../../app/code/Infrastructure/Http/), console, and others
- `Repositories that are used by services to access data` - [sql](./../../app/code/Infrastructure/Persist/Sql/), [session](./../../app/code/Infrastructure/Persist/Session/), [files](./../../app/code/Infrastructure/Persist/Filesystem/)
- `utils to manipulate data` - number or [string generators](./../../app/code/Infrastructure/Utils/TokenGenerators/CsrfTokenGeneratorUseRandomBytes.php) etc.
