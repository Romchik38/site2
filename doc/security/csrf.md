# csrf

**"No `csrf_token` in a POST request, no talk"**.

This means, that all POST request—ñ must be send with this kind of token inside.

## Protected

- `Auth` POST action recieves login form data from `Login` and `Login Admin` actions
- `Admin`
- `Accept terms`
- `Article views`

## Not protected

Some actions do not protected, because they are recieved data from forms, placed in the header or footer. These action must be simple and do not change app *state*.

- `Logout` POST actions

## How it works

There is a *request middleware* `CsrfMiddleware` executing before a target action. The request will be declined if `csrf_token` did not provided with post data.

To make a request successfull, action, which resposable to generate a `<form>`, must place token inside `<form>` as `<input type="hidden">` tag.

Token is available in the twig template via variable `visitor`.
