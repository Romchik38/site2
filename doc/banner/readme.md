# Banner

A `banner` is nothing special and is based on a picture of a specified size. You can assign any `image` on the site as a `banner`. It is possible to assign a `priority` so that the corresponding image is shown more often than others. If necessary, the functionality can be expanded.

The banner is displayed on the main page `/`, on category pages `/category/category_id`, and in recent articles `/article`.

Banner management is done through the admin menu. Go to the link `/admin` and select the corresponding item in the Banners menu.

The visitor is shown `only one banner` based on priority. The `higher the priority`, the `greater the chance` for the banner to be displayed. There is `no banner gallery` on the site.

The banner system is very simple, but it *can be easily expanded* to the required functionality.
