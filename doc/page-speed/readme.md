# PageSpeed

All website pages have the highest (practically the highest) rating according to [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) data.

To achieve this, additional work was done on the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS code.

All pages of the site, except one, are closed for indexing due to the consideration that site2 is not a real website. This lowers the SEO rating for the yellow zone.

Only `/about-this-site` page is open for indexing by search engines and, accordingly, has a high SEO rating.
