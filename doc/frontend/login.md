## Login

You can log in as a user on the external part of the site using the link `/login`. To log in, use your email address as the username and a password.

## Register

You can register using the link `/register`.

The registration page is not real and does not create an actual account. To log in, please go to the login page and use the following:

1. In the `username field`, enter an `email address`. You can use any. Example – `email@example.com`

2. For the `password field`, please follow the rule – length of 8 characters, containing at least one lowercase and one uppercase letter, a number, and at least one special character: _\`$%^*'. The password is not stored. Validation is performed based only on these rules. Example – `aA1_hello`.

## Account

After you log in, the system will redirect you to the account page at `/account`.

## Logout

To end your session, click the `logout` link at the top of the site.
