# Menu

The site menu is created manually by writing in html. If you want to make a dynamic menu, this is an additional option. Perhaps in the future development process the menu will be dynamic.

Possible menu types

- created manually by writing in html (current selection)
- Manage the menu by creating new items in the admin panel

## Created manually by writing in html

This is a current selection of the project, because the site is a demonstrative example. Menu management development is complex and must meet customer requirements. Thus, it can vary significantly.

## Manage the menu by creating new items in the admin panel

Cases:

1. Creation of individual menu items with their translation and URL addresses. Use of specified items to create menus. Possibility of using the same item in several branches.

    OR

2. Using method #1 in combination with controllers - the ability to specify a controller as a menu item, or its dynamic route. For example, the ability to select some category.
