## 1. Description

Currently, the administrative part's menu has not been developed. It appears as a set of links to the corresponding categories. You can see what it looks like on this [prototype](https://site2.romanenko-studio.dev/media/html/admin/menu.html).

You are invited to participate in the open source development of the Site2 project and create the menu yourself.

## 2. Conditions

- Tools
- Appearance
- Quality

### Tools

You can use something from the list below, or everything together:

- Any css styles you like.
- [Bootstrap 5.3.3 css file](./../public/http/media/css/bootstrap-5.3.3-dist/css/bootstrap.min.css).
- Javascript.
- [Javascript components](./../public/http/media/js/modules/components/).

Do not use other dependencies.

You can include additional files, such as images or fonts, if necessary. In that case, all files must be together with the prototype.

### Appearance

- Can contain at least one submenu.
- Can be horizontal or vertical, based on your choice.

### Quality

Your HTML code must pass the [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) test with a score of 100% in the Performance category.

## 3. Development process

- Fork the repository
- You can use the [prototype](./../public/http/media/html/admin/menu.html) as a basis for further development.
- Your work should look like an HTML file, which is located in the /media/html/admin directory.
- Create a pull request or send an [email](mailto:pomahehko.c@gmail.com) to start a review.

## 4. What you get

You will gain **collaborative development experience**, if you need it. This might be important if you want to showcase your participation in open source projects.

You can **add links to your personal website** and GitHub repository to your prototype. This information will be posted on the pages of this repository, and anyone can view your work. Also, your prototype will be open for indexing by search engines on the [preview website](https://site2.romanenko-studio.dev/en). Thus, you will receive a link to your site, which may increase its ranking.

## 5. Additionally

If you undertake this development and do not spend as little time as possible on its completion, and at the same time another developer successfully completes the assigned task, you will lose the opportunity to merge your work. In that case, it will be considered incomplete.

The owner of this repository does not provide any guarantees regarding the placement of your code if you have not fulfilled all the conditions listed above.

## 6. License

Your work will be implemented as part of the Site2 project and may be used under the terms of [the project's general license](./../LICENSE.md).
