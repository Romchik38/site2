# Readme for site2

Site2 demonstrates implementing:

- language routing
- twig view

Based on [php-server](https://github.com/Romchik38/server).

The only dependency is *twig/twig*. You can replace it with any other template engine. All what you must do in this case - replace twig templates with new ones. Core logic will no change.

See docs in [doc folder](./doc/)
